abstract="Hindi is the official language of India and has over 500 million speakers worldwide. Being a dominant language with a widespread impact, implies the need for development of technologies that cater to its native speakers. In this paper, a text mining based information retrieval model has been developed to generate Hindi word embeddings and their application ranking documents in order of relevance to an input query. Word embeddings are multi-dimensional vectors that can be created by utilizing the linguistic context of words in a large corpus. To generate the embeddings, a corpus was created from the Hindi Wikipedia dump, on which the skip-gram approach was applied using a neural network based negative sampling-architecture. The weighted average of each word embedding along with its tf-idf score generated the embeddings for each individual document. The cosine-similarity was then calculated between each document vector and the query vector. Using these similarity scores, the documents were ranked in descending order of relevance to the query. Highly relevant rankings were obtained in response to a query input. The results of the model were visualized using the t-SNE visualization method. The accuracy of this method proves that in the process of conversion of words to numeric vectors, the semantic context of the words was preserved.",
