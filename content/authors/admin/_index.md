I am an incoming Masters student at UC San Diego, where I will be studying Computer Science with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence.

I completed my Bachelor's Degree (B.Tech) with Honours in Computer Engineering at College of Engineering Pune, India in 2020. On graduation I was felicitated as the Computer Engineering branch Gold Medallist and the Institute Topper among all 10 engineering departments. 

Outside of work, I am a history, geography, political science, paperbacks, and Indian culture enthusisast who has recently discovered her fondness for yoga and hiking.
