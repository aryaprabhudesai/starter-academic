I am a first year Masters student at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), where I am studying Computer Science with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence. I completed my Bachelor's Degree (B.Tech) with Honors in Computer Engineering at the [College of Engineering Pune, India](https://www.coep.org.in/), in 2020. I was felicitated as the Computer Engineering department Gold Medallist and ranked 1st in the Institute among 750+ students at [commencement](https://www.coep.org.in/content/graduationceremonyofthefourteenthbatchofengineersheldonthursday29thoctober). 

I am passionate about Deep Learning and have undertaken multiple research internships focused on its application to Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision systems. In particular, my project on Ranking Hindi Documents using Deep Learning bolstered my interest in the application of NLP to regional languages.

Outside of work, I am a history, geography, political science, paperbacks, and Indian culture enthusiast who has recently discovered her fondness for yoga and hiking.
