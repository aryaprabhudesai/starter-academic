title: Face Liveness Detection Against 2D Spoofing Attacks Using a Hybrid Architecture
summary:  We've introduced a novel approach that combines the advantages of neural networks with handcrafted features to perform face liveness detection against 2D spoofing attacks. We also performed a comparative study of the proposed hybrid method with a purely deep learning-based approach. We created a novel Flash Detection dataset for the task that includes images captured under variable flash and distance settings with five types of spoofing attacks.
